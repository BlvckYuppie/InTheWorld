# Project 1 Evaluation
[inline code comments](https://github.com/BlvckYuppie/InTheWorld/pull/1/files)
## Planning / Process / Submission
**1: Progressing**
>App is submitted, with basic evidence of planning. Documentation exists, but lacks common areas such as setup instructions, description of application functionality and link to deployed application

I see you've got a wireframe in your repo, but there's is little documentation beyond that. Something that's essential for any app you make, whether it's a WDI project or not, is including a readme. A readme (most commonly placed in a `readme.md` file) is essential for telling somebody (including prospective employers) what your app is all about, how you go about setting it up/using it, the technologies you used, challenges you encountered, etc. It's a great way to not only describe your project but talk about yourself as well.

## Technical Requirements
**2: Performing**
>App functions with minimal or no errors and is deployed on github pages

I dig the app! It's a fully functional trivia game that keeps track of your score and displays a particular ending depending on that score. Some additional features you can think about now are adding a timer, displaying a score and giving the user the option to restart the game.

I can't seem to load your deployed app -- it causes my browser to crash. Might be stuck in an infinite loop or something. Is there anything about your `gh-pages` Javascript that's different from your master?

## Code Quality
**1: Progressing**
>Code lacks proper formatting, includes commented out, non-functional code, or otherwise contains major issues of quality (DRY, naming, etc)

Keeping your code clean is super important. Something that you should focus on moving forward is being consistent with indentation/spacing and removing commented-out code from the master branch of your project submission. Readability is something prospective employers take very seriously. If you'd like to keep that commented-out code, consider moving it to a separate branch.

## Creativity and Interface
**2: Performing**
>The app displays a personal spin or creative element through its written language, functionality, purpose, and/or CSS. Submission includes proof of HTML / CSS validation

Very fun theme! I knew next to nothing about Top Spin prior to playing around with this, so I feel smarter already! Nice simple interface too. Consider adding the features I mentioned under `Technical Requirements` to take the interface to the next level.

There are a couple errors when you pass your HTML/CSS through a validator. Take a look at those -- they're quick fixes though!
